# SURVIVAL-ANALYSIS-OF-TITANIC_SHIP- 
# EDA with Python
There seems to be many EDA(exploratory data analysis) on the 'TITANIC SHIP' dataset, but none or few considered 'Embark_town' & 'deck'. So I am focusing on Embark_town & deck together with 'Age','Sex' &amp; 'Survival' using Python library.

MY OBJECTIVES is;
* To know if there's any relationship between deck & embark town.
* To check for correlation between deck,embark_town & survival
* Lastly to know if these results correlates with Age,sex & fare.

METHOD;
* To perform simple EDA on the feature 'embark_town' of passenger & 'deck' 
* Using scatter plot to check for relationship between 'embark town' & 'deck'
* To evaluate any correlation between 'deck','emabark_town','age,'sex' & 'survive'

LIBRARY;
* Numpy
* Panda
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sweetviz

NOTE;
* Although I am tempted to use sweetviz Python library for auto profiling &amp; visualization,I will stick to numpy,panda &amp; matplotlib for now.
* This is my first EDA(exploratory data analysis) with Python,so opinions &amp; suggestions are appreciated.
