# SURVIVAL-ANALYSIS-OF-TITANIC_SHIP-
There seems to be many EDA(exploratory data analysis) on Titanic dataset, but none/few include 'Embark_town' &amp; its correlation.    So I am focusing on 'Embark_town' together with 'Age','Sex' &amp; 'Survival'. Although I am tempted to use sweetviz Python library for auto profiling &amp; visualization,I will stick with numpy,panda &amp; matplotlib for now.  NOTE: This is my first EDA(exploratory data analysis) with Python,so opinions &amp; suggestions are appreciated.
